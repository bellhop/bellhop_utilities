# Bellhop Utilities
These are my utilities that I use often and thought I would share them here
> These are based on function found in OS X so some of them will not work on other platforms

---

### Installing
Clone the repo to your favorite location within OS X and then add that location (in this example I put them in my home directory) to your path in you `.bash_profile`

```
export PATH="$HOME/bellhop_utilities/bin":$PATH
```
